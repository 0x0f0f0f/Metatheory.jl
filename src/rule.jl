"""
Construct a `Rule` from a quoted expression.
You can also use the [`@rule`] macro to
create a `Rule`.
## Symbolic Rules

Rules defined as `left_hand => right_hand` are
called `symbolic` rules. Application of a `symbolic` Rule
is a replacement of the `left_hand` pattern with
the `right_hand` substitution, with the correct instantiation
of pattern variables. Function call symbols are not treated as pattern
variables, all other identifiers are treated as pattern variables.
Literals such as `5, :e, "hello"` are not treated as pattern
variables.

## Dynamic Rules

Rules defined as `left_hand |> right_hand` are
called `dynamic` rules. Dynamic rules behave like anonymous functions.
Instead of a symbolic substitution, the right hand of
a dynamic `|>` rule is evaluated during rewriting:
matched values are bound to pattern variables as in a
regular function call. This allows for dynamic computation
of

## Type Assertions

Type assertions are supported in the left hand of rules
to match and access literal values both when using classic
rewriting and EGraph based rewriting.
To use a type assertion pattern, add `::T` after
a pattern variable in the `left_hand` of a rule.

## Examples

Symbolic rule
```julia
Rule(:(a * b => b * a))
```

Dynamic rules computing the actual multiplication of two numbers on
a match
```julia
Rule(:(a::Number * b::Number |> a*b))
```
