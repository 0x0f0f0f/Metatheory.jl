**Metatheory.jl** is a general purpose metaprogramming and algebraic computation library for the Julia programming language, designed to take advantage of the powerful reflection capabilities to bridge the gap between symbolic mathematics, abstract interpretation, equational reasoning, optimization, composable compiler transforms, and advanced
homoiconic pattern matching features.

Intuitively, Metatheory.jl transforms Julia expressions
in other Julia expressions and can achieve such at both compile and run time. This allows Metatheory.jl users to perform customized and composable compiler optimization specifically tailored to single, arbitrary Julia packages.
Our library provides a simple, algebraically composable interface to help scientists in implementing and reasoning about semantics and all kinds of formal systems, by defining concise rewriting rules in pure, syntactically valid Julia on a high level of abstraction. Our implementation of equality saturation on e-graphs is based on the excellent, state-of-the-art technique implemented in the [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io/) library, reimplemented in pure Julia.

If you use Metatheory.jl in your research, please [cite](https://github.com/0x0f0f0f/Metatheory.jl/blob/master/CITATION.bib) our works.

## Installation

**NOTE**: Metatheory.jl requires a Julia version >= 1.6.0 [why?](https://github.com/0x0f0f0f/Metatheory.jl/issues/11)

```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/0x0f0f0f/Metatheory.jl")
```

## Examples

Here are some of examples of the basic workflow of using Metatheory.jl. Theories are composable and reusable!

### Basic Symbolic Mathematics
The e-graphs backend can directly handle associativity,
commutativity and distributivity, rules that are
otherwise known of causing loops in symbolic computations.

```julia
using Metatheory

comm_monoid = @theory begin
    a * b => b * a
    a * 1 => a
    a * (b * c) => (a * b) * c
end
```

The Metatheory library contains utility functions for creating
rules and theories from commonly used algebraic structures and
properties. This is equivalent to the previous theory definition.
```julia
using Metatheory.Library

comm_monoid = commutative_monoid(:(*), 1)
# alternatively
comm_monoid = @commutative_monoid (*) 1
```

Theories are just collections, precisely vectors of rules, and can
be composed as regular julia collections. The most
useful way of composing theories is unioning
them with the '∪' operator.

```julia
comm_group = @theory begin
    a + 0 => a
    a + b => b + a
    a + inv(a) => 0 # inverse
    a + (b + c) => (a + b) + c
end
distrib = @theory begin
    a * (b + c) => (a * b) + (a * c)
end
t = comm_monoid ∪ comm_group ∪ distrib
```

With the e-graph backend, Metatheory.jl can prove simple equalities
very efficiently. The `@areequal` macro takes a theory and some
expressions and returns true iff the expressions are equal
according to the theory. The following example returns true.
```julia
@areequal t (x+y)*(a+b) ((a*(x+y))+b*(x+y)) ((x*(a+b))+y*(a+b))
```

We can use type assertions and dynamic rules, defined with the `|>`
operator, to dynamically compute values in the right hand of expressions
```julia
fold_mul = @theory begin
    a::Number * b::Number |> a*b
end
t = comm_monoid ∪ fold_mul
@areequal t (3*4) 12
```

Let's see a more complex example: extracting the
smallest equivalent expression, from a
trivial mathematics theory

```julia
distrib = @theory begin
	a * (b + c) => (a * b) + (a * c)
	(a * b) + (a * c) => a * (b + c)
end
powers = @theory begin
	a * a => a^2
	a => a^1
	a^n * a^m => a^(n+m)
end
logids = @theory begin
	log(a^n) => n * log(a)
	log(x * y) => log(x) * log(y)
	log(1) => 0
	log(:e) => 1
	:e^(log(x)) => x
end
fold_add = @theory begin
	a::Number + b::Number |> a + b
end
t = comm_monoid ∪ comm_group ∪ distrib ∪ powers ∪ logids ∪ fold_mul ∪ fold_add
```

We can programmatically build and saturate an e-graph.
```julia
G = EGraph(:((log(e) * log(e)) * (log(a^3 * a^2))))
saturate!(G, t)
ex = extract!(G, astsize)

ex == :(5log(a))
```

### A Tiny Imperative Programming Language Interpreter

This example does not use the e-graphs backend. A recursive
algorithm is sufficient for interpreting expressions.
Note how we are representing semantics for a different programming language
by reusing the Julia AST data structure, and therefore efficiently reusing
the Julia parser for our new toy language.
